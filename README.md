This HTML file showcases a job description formatted using HTML syntax as part of my portfolio. It demonstrates my ability to structure content effectively, using tags like &lt;h1>, &lt;p>, &lt;ul>, &lt;li>, and &lt;table> to create a clear, well-organized job description. This project highlights my skills in front-end development and web design.
